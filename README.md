## 🎯 Features

- **Physical Prototype**: Arduino Nano 33 BLE bots (~5 cm diameter) simulating energy, BLE comms, and magnetic “formation mode.”  
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Built with [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/) for rapid prototyping of swarm behaviors.  
- **Global Orchestrator**: Python scripts to step the simulation, broadcast formation commands, and collect stats.  
- **Host CLI**: Simple command-line interface to monitor vitals (simulated) and issue high-level orders.  
- **Modular & Extensible**: Swap in real sensors, add new formation algorithms, or extend the BCI interface.

## Bots broadcast battery & formation status over BLE.

## --Simulation runs in parallel, mirroring physical layout for testing.

## --Orchestrator (global_control/orchestrator.py) steps both worlds and syncs commands.

## --CLI (host_interface/cli.py) lets you check vitals or trigger “FORM” across bots/agents.
