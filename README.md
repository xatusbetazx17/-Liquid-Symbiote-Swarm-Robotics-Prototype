## 🎯 Features

- **Physical Prototype**: Arduino Nano 33 BLE bots (~5 cm diameter) simulating energy, BLE comms, and magnetic “formation mode.”  
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Built with [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/) for rapid prototyping of swarm behaviors.  
- **Global Orchestrator**: Python scripts to step the simulation, broadcast formation commands, and collect stats.  
- **Host CLI**: Simple command-line interface to monitor vitals (simulated) and issue high-level orders.  
- **Modular & Extensible**: Swap in real sensors, add new formation algorithms, or extend the BCI interface.
